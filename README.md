# CS 3650 HWs, Computer Systems

- I took this course during my excahnge program in Northeastern University, this repo has my 
homework assignments in Assembly AMD 64 using RISC Structure and C language.

## C and Assembly

C and Assembly programs are structured the same way: as a collection of
functions, possibly spread across multiple source files.

But C and Assembly are even more closely related: they both have the same
concept of a "function". A function written in either language can be called
transparently from the other.

### HW01:
- simple program that computes the cube of an integer.

### HW02:
- A recurisve implementation of Fibonacci in assembly, and a simple addition calculator, (a + b) sort of thing.

### HW03:
- Quicksort implemented in C and assembly

### HW04:
- Shell tokenizer, that prints out every token in a single line

### HW05:
- A sample sort implementation in C, it exploits multi-threads to imporve the run time
